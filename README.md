### Multi-Line Input
use prefix `/` to find all the available commands, currently only support `/mode` to select multi-line input.

after select `multi-line` mode, for mac and linux, it will use `vim` as default editor, so it required some basic knowledge about `vim`(at least know how to save and quitüòè), for windows, it will use `notepad` as default editor.
